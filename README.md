# Temperature-App
This Project was done in regards to doing the following task:

Create a Django application that takes in temperature readings over time, stores them in a database and shows the data on a timeseries chart. (That means the form has to collect the temp value and a datetime value).

Use Django 1.10 and an SQLite( preferably so it can be part of the code)  database which shall be part of the project. Please push the code to Github and send me the link. Also, include unit tests in your Django project.
